# Guild Re-sync Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Logic (`app/services.py`)

#### Modified `sync_guild_roster()` method:

**Added member tracking:**
```python
# Track current member IDs to identify members who left
current_member_bnet_ids = set()
current_member_names = set()
```

**During roster processing:**
- Each member's `bnet_id` and `(name, realm)` tuple is added to tracking sets
- This creates a snapshot of who is currently in the guild

**Added cleanup logic:**
```python
# Remove characters that are no longer in the guild
existing_characters = Character.query.filter_by(guild_id=guild.id).all()
removed_count = 0

for character in existing_characters:
    is_still_member = False
    
    # Check by bnet_id first (most reliable)
    if character.bnet_id and character.bnet_id in current_member_bnet_ids:
        is_still_member = True
    # Fall back to name + realm check
    elif (character.name, character.realm) in current_member_names:
        is_still_member = True
    
    # Remove character if they're no longer in the guild
    if not is_still_member:
        db.session.delete(character)
        removed_count += 1
```

**Updated return value:**
- Changed from: `return guild, len(members)`
- Changed to: `return guild, len(members), removed_count`
- Now returns the count of removed members

### 2. Route Handler (`app/routes.py`)

#### Modified `sync_guild()` route:

**Updated unpacking:**
```python
guild, member_count, removed_count = service.sync_guild_roster(realm_slug, guild_name_slug)
```

**Enhanced success message:**
```python
success_msg = f'Successfully synced {member_count} members from {guild.name}'
if removed_count > 0:
    success_msg += f' ({removed_count} member{"s" if removed_count != 1 else ""} removed)'

flash(success_msg, 'success')
```

Now shows removed count when members are removed:
- Example: "Successfully synced 864 members from Hordecore Casuals (3 members removed)"

### 3. User Interface (`app/templates/sync.html`)

**Added informational alert:**
```html
<div class="alert alert-info mb-4" role="alert">
    <i class="bi bi-info-circle me-2"></i>
    <strong>Re-syncing a guild:</strong> When you sync a guild that's already been tracked, 
    the roster will be updated. New members will be added, and members who have left the 
    guild will be automatically removed from the database.
</div>
```

### 4. Documentation

**Created `RESYNC_FEATURE.md`:**
- Comprehensive explanation of re-sync functionality
- How member tracking works
- Removal logic details
- Usage instructions
- Logging examples
- Best practices
- Common scenarios

**Updated `README.md`:**
- Enhanced Features section
- Added re-sync explanation in setup instructions
- Link to detailed documentation

## Technical Details

### Member Identification Strategy

The system uses a two-tier identification approach:

1. **Primary: Battle.net ID (`bnet_id`)**
   - Unique identifier assigned by Blizzard
   - Survives name changes
   - Most reliable method

2. **Fallback: Name + Realm tuple**
   - Used when `bnet_id` is not available
   - Handles edge cases for older data

### Why This Matters

A character is removed **only if**:
- Their `bnet_id` is not found in current roster (if they have one), **AND**
- Their `(name, realm)` combination is not found in current roster

This dual-check prevents false removals due to:
- API inconsistencies
- Partial data availability
- Legacy records without `bnet_id`

### Atomicity

All database operations happen in a single transaction:
```python
# ... update characters ...
# ... delete removed characters ...
db.session.commit()  # All or nothing

try:
    # ... operations ...
except Exception as e:
    db.session.rollback()  # Rollback on error
    raise e
```

## Logging Output

Enhanced logging provides detailed sync information:

```
INFO - Starting guild sync for 'hordecore-casuals' on 'dreamscythe'
INFO - ✅ Guild info retrieved: Hordecore Casuals - Dreamscythe
INFO - ✅ Roster retrieved: 864 members found
INFO - Processing 864 members...
INFO - Checking for members who left the guild...
INFO - Removing 'Oldmember' (no longer in guild)
INFO - Removing 'Inactive' (no longer in guild)
INFO - Removing 'Leftguild' (no longer in guild)
INFO - ✅ Guild sync completed successfully!
INFO -    - Total members: 864
INFO -    - Profiles retrieved: 712
INFO -    - Profiles unavailable: 152
INFO -    - Members removed: 3
```

## Benefits

### Data Accuracy
- Always reflects current guild roster
- No stale data from departed members
- Analytics show only active members

### Database Efficiency
- Prevents database bloat
- Removes orphaned records
- Maintains clean data structure

### User Experience
- Clear feedback on membership changes
- Transparent removal process
- Easy to track guild turnover

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Initial sync creates characters
- [x] Re-sync updates existing characters
- [x] Re-sync adds new members
- [x] Re-sync removes departed members
- [x] Success message shows removed count
- [x] Logging shows detailed information
- [x] Transaction rollback on error
- [x] Both `bnet_id` and name+realm tracking work
- [x] UI alert explains re-sync behavior

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Character with no `bnet_id`**: Falls back to name+realm matching
2. **Character transferred servers**: Treated as new character (different realm)
3. **Multiple characters same name**: Differentiated by realm
4. **API failures**: Transaction rolled back, no partial updates
5. **Empty roster**: All existing characters removed
6. **First sync**: No characters to remove (0 removed count)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
- Track removal timestamp
- Store removed member history
- Export membership change reports
- Email notifications for significant changes
- Scheduled automatic re-syncs
- Configurable retention policies
