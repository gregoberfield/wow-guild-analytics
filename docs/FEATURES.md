### How to Use

1. **Navigate to AI Raid Composer:**
   - Go to a guild detail page
   - Click "AI Raid Composer" button
   - Or navigate to `/guild/<id>/raid-composer`

2. **Configure Raid:**
   - Select raid size (20, 25, or 40)

- Guild must have level 60 characters
- Characters must be synced with details (spec, item level)

**User Access:**
- Must be authenticated (logged in)
- Available to all authenticated users (not admin-only)

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Fetches all level 60 characters with class, spec, and item level
2. **AI Analysis:** Sends character roster to GPT-4o with detailed prompts about WoW Classic raid strategy
3. **Composition Generation:** AI generates optimal composition considering:
   - Tank requirements (warriors with defensive stance, druids)
   - Healer balance (priests, druids, paladins, shamans)
   - DPS mix (melee vs. ranged, physical vs. casters)
   - Class buffs (Paladin blessings, Shaman totems, etc.)
   - Debuff slots (Curse of Elements, Shadow Weaving, etc.)
   - Group synergies (Windfury totems for melee, mana users with Spirit, etc.)
4. **Result Display:** Presents composition with group assignments and strategic recommendations

### Notes

- AI suggestions are recommendations, not requirements
- Actual raid composition may vary based on player skill, gear, and encounter mechanics
- The AI considers WoW Classic mechanics and meta strategies
- Token usage and model information displayed for transparency
- If Azure OpenAI is not configured, a warning message is displayed

   - Fetches guild information
   - Creates/updates guild record
   - Fetches roster member list
   - Creates basic character records
   - Tracks new member additions

2. **Character Details Sync**
   - Iterates through all characters
   - Fetches detailed profiles
   - Updates item levels, specs, achievements
   - Tracks progression changes (if stats changed)

3. **Subsequent Syncs**
   - Compares roster with database
   - Adds new members (logs to history)
   - Removes departed members (logs to history, deletes progression)
   - Updates existing character data
   - Creates progression entries only if stats changed

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of private/missing profiles
- Detailed logging of all operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Partial success tracking (successful/failed profiles)

---

## Last Login Tracking

Track when guild members last logged into World of Warcraft.

The Blizzard WoW API provides `last_login_timestamp` in character profiles, allowing you to see member activity at a glance.

### Features

**Display:**
- "Last Seen" column in guild roster table
- Human-readable relative time format
- Sortable column (ascending/descending)
- Graceful handling of missing data

**Time Formats:**
- "Just now" (< 1 minute)

- "3 hours ago" (< 24 hours)
- "2 days ago" (< 7 days)
- "1 week ago" (< 30 days)
- "4 months ago" (< 365 days)
- "1 year ago" (>= 365 days)
- "Unknown" (no data available)

**Use Cases:**
- Identify active members for raid rosters
- Find inactive members for guild cleanup
- Monitor guild engagement trends
- Track login patterns
- Plan activities based on member activity

### How to Use

1. **Sync Guild** - Last login data is captured during sync
2. **View Guild Detail** - Check the "Last Seen" column
3. **Sort by Activity** - Click column header to sort
4. **Identify Active/Inactive** - Most recent logins appear first

### Technical Details

- **Data Source:** Battle.net API `last_login_timestamp`
- **Format:** Unix timestamp in milliseconds
- **Storage:** BIGINT column in Character table
- **Update:** Refreshed on every guild sync
- **Display:** Converted to relative time in template

### Migration

If upgrading from an older version:
```bash
python migrate_add_last_login.py
```

---

## Admin User Management

Manage user accounts and administrative access.

### Default Admin User

On fresh installations, a default admin user is automatically created:
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123
- **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Change this password immediately after first login!

### Automatic Creation

The application automatically creates the default admin user when:
- The database is empty (no users exist)
- Application starts for the first time
- Creates user with full admin privileges

### Management Script

Use `manage_admin.py` for user management:

```bash
# Create default admin user
python manage_admin.py create

# Reset admin password to default
python manage_admin.py reset

# List all users
python manage_admin.py list

# Add new user interactively
python manage_admin.py add

# Show manual SQL commands
python manage_admin.py sql
```

### Manual SQL Commands

If scripts don't work, use direct SQL (see `sql/admin_user_commands.sql`):

```sql
-- Create admin user (password: admin123)
INSERT INTO user (username, email, password_hash, is_admin, is_active, created_at)
VALUES (
    'admin',
    'admin@example.com',
    'scrypt:32768:8:1$jBq8rK9L3qXmEOvC$8c5e2a3d1f9b7e6c4a0d8f1b3e5c7a9d2f4b6e8c0a1d3f5b7e9c1a3d5f7b9e0c2a4d6f8b0c1e3f5a7c9e1b3d5f7a9c0b2d4f6e8a0c1d3f5b7e9c1a3d5f7b9e0c2a4d6f8b',
    1,
    1,
    datetime('now')
);
```

### Troubleshooting

**Empty Database:**
- Run: `python manage_admin.py create`
- Or restart application (auto-creates)
- Or use manual SQL commands

**Forgot Password:**
- Run: `python manage_admin.py reset`
- Resets to default: admin123

**Can't Login:**
- Check user exists: `python manage_admin.py list`
- Verify user is active and admin
- Reset password if needed

### Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Password** - Immediately after first login
2. **Use Strong Passwords** - Minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
3. **Limit Admin Accounts** - Only give admin access to trusted users
4. **Regular Audits** - Review user list periodically
5. **Deactivate Inactive Users** - Don't delete, just deactivate
6. **Secure Database** - Restrict file permissions: `chmod 600 instance/guild_analytics.db`

## Guild History Tracking

Track member additions and removals with complete audit trail.

### Features

**Smart Tracking:**
- Only tracks changes AFTER initial sync
- Skips history entries during first guild import
- Prevents pollution with existing members

**Tracked Events:**

### Initial Sync Behavior

When a guild is synced for the first time:
- All existing members are imported
- NO history entries are created
- History tracking begins from this point

Subsequent syncs will track:
- New members joining (creates "added" entry)
- Members leaving (creates "removed" entry)

### How to Access

1. Navigate to guild detail page
2. Click "View History" button
3. Filter by action type if needed
4. Review member changes over time

### Use Cases

- **Recruitment Tracking** - See when members joined
- **Turnover Analysis** - Identify retention issues
- **Guild Growth** - Monitor membership trends
- **Audit Trail** - Complete history of changes
- **Member Management** - Know who left and when

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Regular Syncing
- Sync rosters regularly to capture member changes
- Run character details sync after roster sync for complete data
- More frequent syncs = more accurate progression tracking
- Syncing updates last login timestamps

### Performance
- Character details sync can take several minutes for large guilds
- Consider syncing during off-peak hours
- Database automatically handles cleanup

### Data Privacy
- Progression history deleted when members leave
- Only publicly available Battle.net data is stored
- No sensitive player information collected
- Last login data from public API only

### Database Maintenance
- Automatic cleanup on member removal
- Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
- Regular syncs keep data fresh
- Run migrations when upgrading

### Security
- Change default admin password immediately
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Limit admin access to trusted users
- Keep .env file secure (in .gitignore)
- Restrict database file permissions

### Guild History
- Initial sync doesn't create history entries
- Only tracks actual changes after first sync
- Prevents clutter with existing members
- Provides clean audit trail
