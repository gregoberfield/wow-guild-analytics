- Strategic recommendations for specific encounters

### How to Use

1. **Navigate to AI Raid Composer:**
   - Go to a guild detail page
   - Click "AI Raid Composer" button
   - Or navigate to `/guild/<id>/raid-composer`

2. **Configure Raid:**
   - Select raid size (20, 25, or 40)

### Requirements

**Azure OpenAI Configuration:**

  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` (default: 'gpt-4o')

**Guild Requirements:**
- Guild must have level 60 characters
- Characters must be synced with details (spec, item level)

**User Access:**
- Must be authenticated (logged in)
- Available to all authenticated users (not admin-only)

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Fetches all level 60 characters with class, spec, and item level
2. **AI Analysis:** Sends character roster to GPT-4o with detailed prompts about WoW Classic raid strategy
3. **Composition Generation:** AI generates optimal composition considering:
   - Tank requirements (warriors with defensive stance, druids)
   - Healer balance (priests, druids, paladins, shamans)
   - DPS mix (melee vs. ranged, physical vs. casters)
   - Class buffs (Paladin blessings, Shaman totems, etc.)
   - Debuff slots (Curse of Elements, Shadow Weaving, etc.)
   - Group synergies (Windfury totems for melee, mana users with Spirit, etc.)
4. **Result Display:** Presents composition with group assignments and strategic recommendations

### Notes

- AI suggestions are recommendations, not requirements
- Actual raid composition may vary based on player skill, gear, and encounter mechanics
- The AI considers WoW Classic mechanics and meta strategies
- Token usage and model information displayed for transparency
- If Azure OpenAI is not configured, a warning message is displayed

   - Tracks progression changes (if stats changed)

3. **Subsequent Syncs**
   - Compares roster with database

## Tips & Best Practices

### Regular Syncing
- Sync rosters regularly to capture member changes
- Run character details sync after roster sync for complete data
- More frequent syncs = more accurate progression tracking

### Performance
- Character details sync can take several minutes for large guilds
- Consider syncing during off-peak hours
- Database automatically handles cleanup

### Data Privacy
- Progression history deleted when members leave
- Only publicly available Battle.net data is stored
- No sensitive player information collected

### Database Maintenance
- Automatic cleanup on member removal
- Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
- Regular syncs keep data fresh
